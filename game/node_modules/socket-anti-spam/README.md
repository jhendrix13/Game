# What it does

##### Tired of users spamming your socket.io emits? this module prevents this. #####

## Changelog

### 5/8/14
 - Changed the readme (added a last step that I forgot to mention but it was detailed in the example 'How does it look'
 
### 5/7/14
 - Can now temp ban after x amount of kicks within x defined of time.
 - Client detection based on ip now instead of socket.id (This is how we keep track of amount kicks and ban accordingly)


# How does it look?

![socketspam.gif](https://bitbucket.org/repo/kR4677/images/1013607973-socketspam.gif)


	// Everyone has this line already when using socket-anti-spam
	var io = require('socket.io').listen(8080,{ log: false });

	// Needed for socket-anti-spam to work correctly
	var antiSpam = require('./antispam');
	var antiSpam = new antiSpam({
		spamCheckInterval: 3000,
		spamMinusPointsPerInterval: 3,
		spamMaxPointsBeforeKick: 9,
		spamEnableTempBan: true,
		spamKicksBeforeTempBan: 3,
		spamTempBanInMinutes: 10,
		removeKickCountAfter: 1,
		debug: false
	});

	 // Everyone has this line already when using socket-anti-spam
	io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
		antiSpam.onConnect(socket); // Needed for socket-anti-spam to work correctly
	});

## And now you are safe from people repeatedly spamming your sockets!


#  How do I use it?

## 1. Start by installing the package:
    npm install socket-anti-spam

## 2. Put this in your server side file AFTER you have defined socket.io variable:
	var antiSpam = require('socket-anti-spam');
	var antiSpam = new antiSpam({
		spamCheckInterval: 3000, // define in how much miliseconds the antispam script gives a minus spamscore point
		spamMinusPointsPerInterval: 3, // how many minus spamscore points after x miliseconds?
		spamMaxPointsBeforeKick: 9, // needed points before kick
		spamEnableTempBan: true, // Enable the temp ban system (temp ban users after x amount of kicks within x amount of time)
		spamKicksBeforeTempBan: 3, // This many kicks needed for a temp ban
		spamTempBanInMinutes: 10, // This many minutes temp ban will be active
		removeKickCountAfter: 1, // This many minutes until the kick counter is decreasing with 1 for the user
		debug: false // debug? not needed
	});
	
## 3. Put this inbetween the socket.on connection @ server side
	io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
		antiSpam.onConnect(socket);
	});
	
Now all sockets will be individually checked if they spam your socket.emits and if they do they will be disconnected.
